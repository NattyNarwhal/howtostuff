***Async Workers***
You may also want to install Eventlet or Gevent if you expect that your application code may need to pause for extended periods of time during request processing. Check out the design docs for more information on when youâ€™ll want to consider one of the alternate worker types.
```
$ pip install greenlet            # Required for both
$ pip install eventlet            # For eventlet workers
$ pip install gunicorn[eventlet]  # Or, using extra
$ pip install gevent              # For gevent workers
$ pip install gunicorn[gevent]    # Or, using extra
```
